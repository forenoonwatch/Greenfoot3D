# Greenfoot3D
-------------

#### Description:
Greenfoot3D is a 3D game engine built inside of Greenfoot, a very simple 2D game engine used for teaching students how to use the Java programming language. It features texture loading, object loading, directional ambient lighting, raycasting support, and very simple AABB colliders.

It was originally created in 2015 during my Sophomore year of high school during which time I was taking a Java programming course where the students used Greenfoot.
